      <h1> AB TESTING </h1>
      <p> Through the use of consumer testing, AB Testing has proven to be an effective
        mechanism for comparing potential options by eliminating designer bias when
        determining which of two designs will be most effective. Given two proposed
        interfaces for a Taxi Company, we will use statistical calculations to compare
        and contrast these two designs. The interfaces will be compared using click
        through rate, time to click, dwell time, and return rate. </p>

      <h1> interfaces </h1>
      <p> Since the focus of this project was to record differences in user interactions,
      there was no focus on the style of the website. Instead we tried to incorporate different
      features on each website that might yield different types of user interactions
      (visible info vs. pop-up info, how obvious buttons appear, etc.). </p>

      <h1> heatmaps </h1>
      <p> Utilizing eye-tracking software, we were able to gather information about
        where users would focus their attention on each interface, and how these
        differences could be interpreted based on the design of the interface itself. </p>

      <h1> eye-tracking maps </h1>
      <p> Also utilizing eye-tracking software, we were able to gather information about
        generally what users would look at each interface by tracking where their eyes
        gazed as they explored the page, rather than how much time they spent looking at
        each component (as the heatmap shows). </p>
