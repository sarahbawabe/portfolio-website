        <h2> Project Overview: </h2>
        <p class="infoPar">  Our development project is a website that allows users to filter
        and sort the restaurants on Thayer St on Brown's campus! The user can filter the
        restaurants by type of food served, whether that restaurant's food can be purchased
        on the UberEats app, and the user can sort the restaurants alphabetically and by
        what time the restaurants close (earliest to latest). Finally, the users are able
        to favorite restaurants, and then view a list of all of the restaurants that the
        user has favorited. This favorited list can also be sorted and filtered. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="infoItem">
        <h2> Goals: </h2>
        <p class="infoPar"> The high-level goal of our app is to allow Brown University
        students and Providence residents to view a comprehensive list of all restaurants
        on Thayer St to see all of their dining options. It allows users to filter and
        sort the restaurants to better select which restaurant they want to go to. </p>

        <h2> Design Principles: </h2>
        <p class="infoPar"> Our App is design to have a both easy-to-use and interactive
        interface. We chose to use strong contrasts in labels, in order to make text
        as easy to read as possible. Similarly, we chose commonly used icons like the
        outlined heart and the filled in heart to symbolize and represent whether or not
        a restaurant has been favorited. We also organized our website so that the
        dropdown menus appear "clickable", and so that the user easily knows what they
        have selected through the updating labels located below the dropdowns. We also
        aimed to have a sleek and clean design, where users could easily see what type
        of food they were looking at based not only on filters but also on the component's
        associated photo. This helps ease both the readability and the usability of the
        website, and better clarify to the user what types of food they should expect
        from certain restaurants. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="infoItem">
        <h2> Program Design: </h2>
        <p class="infoPar"> We have our main App class which takes in a list of restaurants,
        which each contain a variety of descriptors such as type of food served, availability
        on UberEats, closing time, and more. This info was then passed in to our FilteredList
        class, which dealt with sorting and filtering functionalities. The FilteredList
        does the filtering and sorting on a List (List.jsx), which is made up of ListItems
        (ListItem.jsx). The List component tracks whether or not items in the list have
        been favorited, so that it returns the correct list to FilteredList. In order to
        determine whether or not a ListItem has been favorited, ListItem contains the
        functionality to store its current state (isFavorited = Yes/No). In order to
        ensure that the labels which tell the user what filters they have applied is
        up-to-date, we created a SelectedLabel class which takes in a prop representing
        whichever state it is handling (e.g. Type of Food). This way, within our FilteredList
        we could create new instances of SelectedLabel which were passed the current states
        of our filters/sorts. </p>
