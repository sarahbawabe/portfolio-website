      <h1> ITERATIVE DESIGN </h1>
      <p> In an attempt to better understand the purpose of iterative design and
        user testing in the context of user interfaces and user experience (UI/UX),
        we chose to create a prototype for the startup DEX and test our prototype
        with various audiences. The startup Dex is here to better connect the world
        by reminding users to reach out to people they haven’t been in contact with recently. Dex
        allows users to sync their contacts and calendars in order to keep track
        of their socialization with various people. It also helps users organize
        and keep track of their conversations, by allowing for note-taking based
        on previous conversations, life updates, and more. We chose to design a
        mobile app for smartphones, in order to easily sync with common phone
        features, such as contacts, calendars, text-messaging, and calling. </p>

      <p id="dexBlurb"> “ Dex is a personal CRM. You sync up your contacts/calendars,
        and it finds the people you haven’t kept in touch with and reminds you to
        reach out. You can add notes about a contact — like what you last spoke
        about, or what’s going on in their life — to help with the conversation
        next time you see them. ” - Creators of DEX

      <h1> pre-design questions </h1>

      <p> As we begin to think about our prototype design, we must consider a few
        pre-design questions, which help guide us towards creating a usable,
        effective, and clean interface.
      </p>

      <div class="questionBox">
        <h2> 1. What is a group of people that will be directly impacted by your
          interface? </h2>
        <p class="answer">  We envision our interface being used by college students,
          young adults, and parents with an overall age range of 18-60. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="questionBox">
        <h2> 2. What is a group of people that will be indirectly impacted by your
          interface? </h2>
        <p class="answer">  All of the contacts of Dex users will be directly
          impacted by our interface.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="questionBox">
        <h2> 3. How are these groups affected by your interface? What are some
          questions that your interface should address to ethically handle these
          effects? </h2>
        <p class="answer">  The group of people that are directly impacted by our
          interface will likely use the interface to connect with friends and family,
          organize their calendars, and overall to organize their social lives. The
          group of people that are indirectly impacted by our interface are affected
          because the Dex users will be notified to contact them and they will likely
          be contacted as a result of the interface. Overall, our interface affects
          people by encouraging contact between them, thus increasing communication
          and socialization. Our interface should address the questions: “Are people
          voluntarily being put in contact with each other?”, “Is there a way to
          report inappropriate users?”, “How can we ensure that users are over the
          age of 18?”, “How can we make sure that the system doesn’t discriminate
          against certain contacts?”, and “How do we maintain the user’s privacy?”.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1> preliminary sketches </h1>
        <img src="sketches-01.png" id="sketches">
      </div>

      <p> In making our first prototype, we focused mostly on creating a simple,
        aesthetic, and logical prototype that would complete the task outlined by
        DEX. We also dedicated time to ensure that this app would maintain the
        user’s privacy, by allowing the user to manually mute notifications, block,
        and update notes as they please. After watching the user attempt to navigate
        our interface at the critique, we noticed that they were confused by the
        functionality of certain icons and buttons. Similarly, the critique helped
        provide us with valuable insight into the concerns that users might have
        when using the interface—specifically regarding the order of the pages,
        size and choice of icons, unexpected ease of blocking people, and more.
        In order to alleviate these issues, we altered many of our icons per the
        suggestions of the critique, and changed certain wordings in the interface
        that had accidentally implied blocking a user rather than simply removing
        a notification.</p>
