      <h1> REDESIGN </h1>
      <p> StackOverflow is a website used for asking and answering technical
        questions online. However, many of its components and features are unclear
        to the user and, in my opinion, can be deemed unnecessary. Below is a
        snapshot of the Questions page on the StackOverflow website, the page that
        users will be brought to first when looking for a question. </p>

    <p>While some pages on this website do have a clearer design, the main purpose
      and use of StackOverflow is to ask and answer questions, so it is critical
      that the Questions page be simple and easy to use, given that it is so
      integral to the site’s overall purpose. Similarly, when a question is
      clicked on, the specific Question page also leaves the user unclear
      about many features.</p>

    <p> While the scope of this project was simply to redesign one page of this
    website, in order to one day further this project a flowchart of each redesigned
    wireframe was created. This flowchart is shown below. </p>

    <p> This new design (see below) is much simpler, and employs only the more necessary features.
      More logical icons are used (thumbs up for “Like” and bookmark for “bookmark”)
      so that both new users and returning users can clearly and efficiently understand
      how to utilize these features. Since the main focus of this website is to
      ask and answer questions, I chose to emphasize the search bar and the “Ask
      a Question” button, unlike the original design which hid these in the corner
      of the screen. I also used a new color palette which better reflects the theme
      colors of StackOverflow—greys, oranges, and whites. Before, the website used
      a variety of blues, yellows, and more which felt very out-of-place. This new
      design also employs a grid design, which clearly organizes the website and
      creates a less cluttered feel.</p>
